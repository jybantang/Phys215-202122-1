# Welcome to Physics 215 Repository (v.202122-1)
*by: Johnrob Y. Bantang, Ph.D.*


This is a repository of the codes, notes, and slides used in a course on High-Performance Computing using Julia as the language (Physics 215: Computational Methods of Physics) at the [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph), [College of Science](http://science.upd.edu.ph), [University of the Philippines in Diliman](http://upd.edu.ph).

This course is taught in the 2nd semester of the academic year 2021-2022.

Most codes are based on those in the books used as textbook and references. 
Copyright mode is MIT since it covers the copyright mode of those references.

Please drop me a [note](mailto:jybantang@up.edu.ph) for any possible copyright problem since I'm making this public for my class.

### Submission modes
Two possible modes of submission is possible.
In both cases, submission must be done through the Google Classroom.
All `[filename]` must have the following pattern: `Session[n]-[Surname-GivenName]-[Exercise/File-short-title]` with the appropriate extension name.
1. **Option 1 -- Jupyter nb file**: Submit a Jupyter notebook file with the following name format `[filename].ipynb`.
   Other related files must be submitted accordingly changing the portion `[Exercise/File-short-title]`.
2. **Option 2 -- GitHub link**: Comment under "Private Comments" the link of the `.ipynb` file in your GitHub repository.
   The repository or at least the file must be public or at least accessible to the Instructor.
   Upload a PDF version of the Jupyter notebook of the same filename base ---after having run all necessary commands--- together with the same functions files stated in Option 1.
