This is a repository of the codes used in a course on High-Performance Computing using Julia as the language (Physics 215: Computational Methods of Physics) at the [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph), [University of the Philippines in Diliman](http://upd.edu.ph).
Most codes are based on those in the books used as textbook and references. 
Copyright mode is MIT since it covers the copyright mode of those references.
