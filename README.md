*by: Johnrob Y. Bantang, Ph.D.*

This is a repository of the codes, notes, and slides used in a course on High-Performance Computing using Julia as the language (Physics 215: Computational Methods of Physics) at the [National Institute of Physics](http://nip.upd.edu.ph), [University of the Philippines in Diliman](http://upd.edu.ph).
This course is taught in the 2nd semester of the academic year 2021-2022.

Most codes are based on those in the books used as textbook and references. 
Copyright mode is MIT since it covers the copyright mode of those references.

Please send me a note for any possible copyright problem since I'm making this public for my class.
