# mProject : Mini-project ideas

**OBJECTIVE:** Identify critical principles of simulation and modeling in at least one project involving physical system modeling or simulation

The simulation can be taken from different dynamical systems well-known in Physics such as
 - [Chaos](./Chaos/README.md)
 - [Cellular automata](./Cellular-Automata/README.md)
 - [Game theory](./Game-Theory/README.md)

You may suggest other topics / systems not included in this listing.

*Special condition*: Submitted as individual or up to trio

Key results
 - [ ] Approved proposed project topic based on well-recognized dynamical system (not active research)
 - [ ] Replicated result(s) such as plot of the original work.
 - [ ] Demonstrated at least one(1) of the Course Goals found in the [Syllabus](../SYLLABUS.md).
  The specific goal must be identified (G1 to G3).
