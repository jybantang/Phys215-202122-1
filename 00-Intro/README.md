# Session 0: Installation and exploration of the Julia language

## OBJECTIVE: Successfully Explore Julia
- [ ] **KR1:** Julia can be run using the terminal, the Julia REPL appears
- [ ] **KR2:** Execute via the Julia REPL basic arithmetic expressions such as 2+3, or 3^4
- [ ] **KR3:** Tried several basic mathematical operations such as exponentiation, as well as known functions such as trigonometric and exponents.
- [ ] **KR4:** Switched to the four REPL modes (check the docs for these)
- [ ] **KR5:** Assign a generated 30x30 random matrix via the command rand()
- [ ] **KR6:** Try out other basic tricks in one of the tutorial pages.

## Some notes
Here, I initially utilized the `Pluto` package of Julia.
You may check out `j1-basic-julia.jl` for the exploration.
Some tricks may be found in the `j1-plot-mandel.jl`.
